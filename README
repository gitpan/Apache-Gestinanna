                        Apache::Gestinanna 0.02
                        -----------------------

This module manages the Apache request cycle for the Gestinanna 
Application Framework.  This package also includes an AxKit content 
provider.

The Apache::Gestinanna documentation contains an example httpd.conf 
configuration as well as a resource file configuration.  Both of these 
are required for the framework to find its configuration and content 
resources.

The actual framework is in the Gestinanna package which is a pre-
requisite for this package.

You will also need to put the files in stylesheets/ into a directory 
under the document root.  The final.xsl xslt expects these in 
http://site.name/stylesheets/, so you may need to edit final.xslt if 
you want to put them somewhere else.  This should change evenetually.

THIS CODE IS ALPHA.  Everything is subject to change.  There are bugs.

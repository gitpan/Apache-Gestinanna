                        -----------------------

This module manages the Apache request cycle for the Gestinanna 
Application Framework.  This package also includes an AxKit content 
provider.

The Apache::Gestinanna documentation contains an example httpd.conf 
configuration as well as a resource file configuration.  Both of these 
are required for the framework to find its configuration and content 
resources.

The actual framework is in the Gestinanna package which is a pre-
requisite for this package.

THIS CODE IS PRE-ALPHA.  Everything is subject to change.  There are 
bugs.
